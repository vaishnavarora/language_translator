# language_translator

This code was made using python.
We have used the concept of file handling in this system so that we can Learn Two concepts at a time.
It basically runs :- 
1. You need to import the modules
2. Select the language you want to translate the text to
3. Open a file in read mode with text in it to convert
4. Translate the text
5. Write it into another file
6. Boom you are ready to check the result in the file

Remember to use the encoding UTF-8
